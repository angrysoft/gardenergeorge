              <p>
                Aeration and detaching  important component in a healthy lawn. Aeration allows water, air and nutrients to reach the root system of you lawn. Detaching will remove thatch which acts as a barrier to water, air and nutrient getting to the roots of the grass. Those treatments should be done minimum once a year and twice when grass clippings are mulched not collected or heavy traffic on lawn is present.

              <p>
                Overseeding is necessary in order to increase the density of lawn. Most of the lawn overseeding we do, is done after Aeration and Detaching. Grass seeds can get to the holes which were done by Aerator and rows done by Scarifier. We usually offer Topdressing the lawn as well with this service. In this process we add a fine layer of : mixed quality, sand when is problem with driainage or fine compost when you have poor quality top soil.
