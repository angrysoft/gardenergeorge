              <p>George assessed the job promptly, listened to what we wanted, gave me a full breakdown of what he would do & we agreed. Everything was done as agreed. He worked quietly & was very tidy. Very pleasant. Did everything on time. George has gardening & cultivating skills which I wanted as I didn't want just a clear out & demolition job done. Will use Georges services again for sure. I recommend George highly.</p>

              <p>Iam delighted with George's service,he did great work on both my front & rear gardens,so much so I will be contacting him again in a couple of weeks to carry out more work.His pricing was reasonable,turned up the day he said he would and cleaned up after he finished. I would have no hesitation in recomending George. it's great that I have at last found a gardener who I can rely on. Trademen is a great site and I would certainly recomend it to anyone to use this it. Many Thanks. M.Pollard.</p>

              <p>George completed some work on a garden for me while I was out of the country. He called round to give a quote, he took some 'before pictures', emailed me the pictures along with the quote. He completed the job to my complete satisfaction. He even sent me the 'after pictures'! To me that is service above and beyond the call. A complete job, well done! Thanks George! Tony Hickey.</p>

              <p>George worked on our back garden. The garden had become overgrown and full of weeds. George was able to cut the grass back to a normal level, returning a week later to ensure that the bottom layer of grass was cut also. He also cut back the hedges and levelled them off. The garden looked great afterwards and I was delighted with the transformation. I would highly recommend George, he was friendly, easy to deal with and explained what he was doing at all times</p>

              <p>I had George and his partner cut the grass at my house in Blackrock and they did a fantastic job. They were very efficient, completed the job very quickly and took the grass away leaving the garden looking neat and tidy. I would highly recommend them to others and will hire them again in the near future. Their rates are very competitive too. Thanks to <a href="http://tradesmen.ie/">tradesmen.ie</a> for this grear service.</p>

              <p>George was very quick to reply to my ad and came to review the job the next day, early. He completed work the following day, was very tidy, efficient, friendly and gave full instructions for after care of lawn. Highly recommended.</p>
